# Git Workshop on Diff, Merge, and Rebase

### Step 1: Create branches, show diffs and merge.

* Create a new git repo, Add README.md and index.html file (default atom html snippet).
```shell
mkdir git-examples
cd git-examples
git init
touch README.md
atom .
```

* Go to GitHub and create a new repo.
  * Set the origin of your repo (local) to the GitHub repo.
```
git remote add origin <url>
```

* Run `git diff`
  * This shows the difference between the staging area and unstaged changes.
  * git diff can be run on   

* Add, commit and push these changes to github.
```shell
git add -A .
git commit -m 'Initial Commit with README'
git push -u origin master
```

* run `git log` to see the new commit in the history.  Run `git status` and `git diff` to see that there are not changes in your working dir.

#### Branching

Git stores data as snapshots

!['snapshots'][snapshots]

[snapshots]:https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/snapshots.png

Git uses pointers to keep track of the different branches and working copy.

* Create a development branch.
* Then create a topic branch
```
git branch devel
git branch
git checkout devel
git branch
git checkout -b new_feature
git branch
```
`git checkout -b new_feature` is a short cut that is equivalent to running both the branch and checkout commands.

  This creates a new branch called devel starting from the tip of the master branch and makes it your working branch.  Then another new branch is created starting from the tip of devel.  In this case the tips of master and devel are the same branch.  It is common to have multiple pointers pointing to the same snapshot.  

* run `git branch` to see the branches.  The `*` is the active branch.
* run `git log --all --graph --decorate --oneline`.  (make an alias to this command - mine is `gitg`) This shows all commits in all the branches and
label the branches and the HEAD.  To make the alias add this line to ~/.bash_profile :
```bash
alias gitg='git log --all --graph --decorate --oneline'
```
* create `css/style.css` and add content then run `git diff`.  Notice that style.css is not in the diff.  Only tracked files are in the diff.
* run `git add -A` and `git diff`.  Notice that there is still no output.  Run `git diff --staged` this shows staged changes.
  * This shows the difference between the HEAD and the changes staged for commit.
* commit the changes.
* run `gitg` (Or what you named the alias).  Output should look like this:

```
* 247c577 (HEAD -> new_feature) Readme updates and added css/style.css
* d9a638e (master) update to readme
* 26988b1 (origin/master) Initial commit of README and index on branch master
```

* run `git checkout master` to change back to the master branch.  run `git merge new_feature` to bring the changes in from the new_feature branch.  Output should look something like this.
```
Updating fef96c8..d61c78e
Fast-forward
 style.css | 4 ++++
 1 file changed, 4 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 style.css
```

When git indicates a "Fast-forward", a merge of the source files was not nessecary, instead only a change of the point to the tip of the master branch was made.  

* `gitg` still shows a linear series of changes.
```
* d61c78e (HEAD -> devel, new_feature) added style.css
* fef96c8 (master) initial commit
```
---

* edit the index.html file in the master branch; switch to the new_feature branch; edit the same lines in the new_feature branch.
* commit these changes to the new_feature branch.
* `gitg` now shows diverging branches.  Note that the HEAD is the most recent commit on new_feature.

```
* 7ca53cd (HEAD -> new_feature) new_feature branch commit
| * b1aeee4 (devel) devel branch commit
|/  
* d61c78e added style.css
* fef96c8 (master) initial commit
```

* `git checkout master`.  Now the HEAD is now the most recent commit on master.
* run `git merge new_feature`.  Git will indicate that there are conflicts.  

```
Auto-merging index.html
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in index.html
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```
---

* Open the index.html file in an editor to manually fix the conflicts.  You should see something like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
<<<<<<< HEAD
    <title>This is the title on the devel branch.</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>The devel heading.</h1>
=======
    <title>The title on new_feature branch</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>New Feature Heading</h1>
>>>>>>> new_feature

  </body>
</html>
```

* Git has indicated where in the file both branches contain changes.
  * Edit the file between `<<<<<<< HEAD`  and `>>>>>>> new_feature` to select the parts of the two commits you want to keep.  Delete the unneeded parts.  Remove `<<<<<<< HEAD`, `>>>>>>> new_feature`, and `=======` lines.

* commit the merge commit.  `gitg` now shows the diverging branches merged.
* run `git branch --merged` to view branches with work that has been merged.
  * This will show that the changes in the new_feature branch have been merged into another branch (devel)
* run `git branch --no-merged` to view branch with work that has not been merged.  Now this will show nothing.
  * Therefore the new_feature branch may be deleted with `git branch -d new_feature`
    * This just removes the pointer to the new_feature branch.  No snapshots were removed.
* Final output of `gitg`;

```
*   63a4f2d (HEAD -> master) fixed the merge conflict
|\  
| * e6e89fc changes to index.html in new_feature branch
* | 45d6a98 readme update
* | 47d5426 edits to index.html
|/  
* 870cc7a updated readme
* 247c577 Readme updates and added css/style.css
* d9a638e update to readme
* 26988b1 (origin/master) Initial commit of README and index on branch master
```

---

### Step 2: Merging with Rebase

* Create a new branch dev from the HEAD (master branch).
  * It is common to have long running branches for development
* add a new file `js/main.js` in the dev branch. (Make a commit).
* Create a branch off dev called new_function.
* create a new function in main.js in new_function branch. (make a commit).
* go back to dev and add a function there as well. (make a commit).
* checkout the new_function branch.
* `git rebase dev`
  * If merge conflicts, fix manually then `git add -A` and `git rebase --continue`
* These commands replay the new_function changes on dev.  The pointer for the dev branch is still behind the latest commit.
* run `git checkout dev && git merge new_function` to fast-forward the dev pointer.

Output of `gitg` now should look like this:

```
* 803106c (HEAD -> dev, origin/new_function, origin/dev, new_function) Added a new function in new_function branch
* 388eb7c new function on dev branch
* 36d500b added main.js to dev branch
*   63a4f2d (origin/master, master) fixed the merge conflict
|\  
| * e6e89fc changes to index.html in new_feature branch
* | 45d6a98 readme update
* | 47d5426 edits to index.html
|/  
* 870cc7a updated readme
* 247c577 Readme updates and added css/style.css
* d9a638e update to readme
* 26988b1 Initial commit of README and index on branch master
```

Notice that the rebase merged the changes from the new_function branch, but the commit history looks linear.

---

#### More complicated rebase

* From the tip of `dev`, create a new branch `server` and checkout `server`
* make a file `server/server.js`
* commit
* make a file `route/index.js`
* commit
* gitg

```*
* 1221876 (HEAD -> server) added index route js file
* 879cba2 added the server js file
*   c3c129d (devel) merge commit
|\  
| * 7ca53cd (new_feature) new_feature branch commit
* | b1aeee4 devel branch commit
|/  
* d61c78e added style.css
* fef96c8 (master) initial commit
```

* checkout the previous commit of `server` branch:
  * `git checkout 879cba2`
* `git rebase --onto devel server client`
* `git checkout devel && git merge client`
  * None of the `server` branch changes were
* We no longer need the client branch: `git branch -d client`


This graphic describes the rebase:

#### Problems with rebase

* The team repo includes a merge commit (C6)
* You based work off of C1 and pulled from the server.  You merge your work with the remote, creating C7.

![](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/perils-of-rebasing-2.png)

* Later your co-worker decides to rebase C4 onto C5 (this effectivily removes the C6 merge commit from the server history) `git push --force` allows this.

![](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/perils-of-rebasing-3.png)

* Now you pull from the server.
