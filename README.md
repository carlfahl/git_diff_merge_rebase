# Git Workshop on Diff, Merge, and Rebase

### Step 1: Create branches, show diffs and merge.

* Create a new git repo, Add README.md and index.html file (default atom html snippet).
* Add, commit and push these changes to github.
* run `git log` to see the new commit in the history.  run `git status` and `git diff` to see that there are not changes in your working dir.
* Create a topic branch `git branch new_feature` then `git checkout new_feature`.  This creates a new branch and makes it your working branch.
`git checkout -b new_feature` is a short cut that is equivalent to running both commands.
